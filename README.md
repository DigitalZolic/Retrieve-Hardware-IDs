Just a neat little but direct and very effective script i wrote which will run on any windows system. Released as fully open source and runs perfectly offline. It does not import, export, alter, change or modify any system settings. It also does not leave residudes or trace files.

So what does the script do?
- Its pretty straight forward. It scans any windows system and then displays the unique system hardware serials / hardware ids.

What is this good for?
Well. If you're using a HWID Spoofer or HWID Virtualizer but are unsure if the HWID Spoofer / HWID Virtualizer actually did change all the neccesary Hardware Serials / Hardware IDs in order to really bypass a HWID Ban. Then this tool will help.
Run this tool first to check your original hardware id serials, then run the Spoofer or Virtualizer and run this tool again. Compare the changes.

What hardware serials and system sections will it scan for? It will scan and display YOUR SYSTEM values for these system sections. Make sure all serials are changed in order to really bypass any kind of hardware id ban.
